## The Problem
I had a SONY Bravia HDTV (KDL46EX500) that allowed you to switch the audio output between the built-in speakers and a fixed-level RCA-style line out and an optical out (no headset output on this one).  The fixed-level line out and optical line out are options meant for A/V Receiver-based setups, which are controlled by their own remote control.

Despite this being the case, it's technically still somewhat possible to download a copy of the latest firmware and modify it to do my bidding (NOT what I ended up doing).  This would require reading through the possibly-zipped/packaged assembly code meant to be installed on the destination hardware.  The dangers with this
