## Turn Your Raspberry Pi into an [IR/Infrared Remote Control](./RaspberryPi_InfraredRemoteControl/)
I had run into issues with infrared remote control routines available on the internet for the Raspberry Pi.  The main issues:  being forced to use some specialized hardware that cost as much as a Raspberry Pi or getting interrupted by the Linux kernel all the time when controlling pins myself!  Check out the [details](./RaspberryPi_InfraredRemoteControl) for how I overcame those issues.

## Adding a [Variable-Volume Line Out](./Adding_Variable_Volume_LineOut_to_TV) to my Sony Bravia TV
My Sony (great company) Bravia HDTV has built-in speakers and a fixed-level line out.  I had a Logitech Z323 2-way + subwoofer speaker system with a volume knob.  This is how I merged the two and kept my remote volume control!

## [Calculating](./) (instead of PSPICE'ing) the value of the Resistor Mass in [XKCD #730](https://xkcd.com/730/)
I couldn't find anyone who had simply calculated the value of the resistor mass, vs finding it in PSPICE, so I thought I'd go ahead and do that.  Hint:  there are 27 unknowns.
